# **Network Speed Test - Hackathon Assignment**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a client-server application to test network speed by comparing **UDP** and **TCP** file transfers. It evaluates how these protocols perform when sharing the same network under varying conditions. The application is designed to handle concurrent connections and provide detailed metrics on transfer performance.

---

## **Features**
- **Protocol Support**:
  - Compare network performance using both **TCP** and **UDP**.
- **Threadings**:
  - Simultaneously manage multiple TCP and UDP connections.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Measure download speed, transfer duration, latency, and packet success rates.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Robust error detection for corrupted messages and connection failures.
- **Hackathon-Ready**:
  - Interoperable with other teams' implementations.
